  Hello! I made a coupla games abt words.
  These are coded from memory from when I 
made them a year or two ago; before my 
computer broke and deleted my cloud.
  Make sure u have wonderwords installed:
         `pip install wonderwords`
  As long as u have a knowledge on how 2 play 
the games, it should go swimmingly. There is
a small bug in wordle, but it rarely happens.
  Have fun! :D
